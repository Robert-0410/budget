## Road Map
- Needs a database
- Needs a command to add incoming funds
- Command to subtract outgoing funds
- We will also need to remove entries from the database
- Needs a command to show the current balance
- Needs a way to view transactions
- Should be encrypted, maybe it can ask to login in. This could even enable us to have separate budget ledgers.
