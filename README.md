# budget
A CLI tool to balance a budget.

## Features

## Install
### Unix Based OS
`make`

## Useful Commands

## Road Map
- We will also need to remove entries from the database
- Needs a command to show the current balance
- Should be encrypted, maybe it can ask to login in. This could even enable us to have separate budget ledgers.
